##🤖 Hugging Face AI Backend
A modular Node.js + Express backend that integrates with the Hugging Face Inference API to perform a variety of NLP tasks — all accessible via clean REST endpoints.
Built as part of my weekly computer science learning journey, this project focuses on API integration, backend architecture, and multi‑model NLP workflows.

#🎯 Learning Goals
This week’s focus:
- REST API Design — Structuring multiple AI endpoints in Express
- Third‑Party API Integration — Authenticating and calling Hugging Face models
- Environment Configuration — Managing secrets and model settings with .env
- Error Handling — Gracefully handling cold starts, rate limits, and invalid tokens
- Modular Code Structure — Separating routes, services, and utilities for maintainability

#🚀 Features
- Summarization — Condense long text into concise summaries
- Sentiment Analysis — Detect positive/negative/neutral tone
- Zero‑Shot Classification — Classify text into arbitrary labels without retraining
- Translation — Translate text between languages
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) — Extract people, places, and organizations
- Question Answering — Answer questions from a given context
- Text Generation — Generate text from prompts
- Paraphrasing — Rewrite sentences while preserving meaning

#📦 Tech Stack
- Node.js — Backend runtime
- Express — Routing and middleware
- node-fetch — HTTP requests to Hugging Face API
- dotenv — Environment variable management
- Hugging Face Inference API — NLP model hosting

#🏗️ How It Works
- Routes — Each NLP task has its own Express route
- Service Layer — huggingface.js handles API calls to specific models
- Environment Variables — .env defines token and model names
- Error Handling — Centralized middleware catches and formats errors
- Extensibility — Add new models/endpoints by creating a service function and route

#📚 Part of My Learning Journey
This project is part of my weekly exploration of computer science concepts.
Each week, I pick a new topic or technology to dive into through hands‑on projects.
This week: Hugging Face API integration and multi‑model NLP backend design.
Previous weeks have included:
- Database design
- Compiler theory
- Distributed systems
- Rust’s async ecosystem and network programming
The goal is to continuously expand my CS knowledge through practical implementation.

#🎓 What I Learned
- How to authenticate and interact with Hugging Face’s Inference API
- Handling model cold starts and rate limits in production code
- Designing modular, extensible backend services
- Mapping different NLP tasks to their respective models
- Debugging and logging API responses for faster iteration

#⚠️ Educational Purpose
This backend is designed for educational purposes and learning about NLP integration.
Always ensure you comply with API usage limits and model license terms.

Built with 💻 Node.js, Express, and a passion for learning something new every week.

If you want, I can now add a Quick Test Suite section so anyone can run one script to hit all endpoints and see them in action — would you like me to add that next?
